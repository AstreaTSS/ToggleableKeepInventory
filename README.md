# ToggleableKeepInventory 

A simple Minecraft plugin that allows for users to toggle their own keepInventory preferences.

More specifically, this plugin allows users to use `/keepinv` to decide if they want to keep their inventory on death or not.

## Features
- Small and lightweight
- Doesn't store any files
- No configuration required
- Integrates with permission systems
- Uses `/gamerule keepInventory` for the world as a default if user does not use `/keepinv`

## Notes
- This supports Bukkit/Spigot/Paper 1.18.2+. Support for other servers types is unlikely.
- The one permission this mod provides is `togglekeepinv.command`.
